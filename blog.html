                                    <h2>3 THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE STARTING YOUR FIRST JOB AFTER GRADUATION</h2>
                                </a>
                                <p>Getting a job after graduation is a great feeling. Some people find a job with little to no effort while others may have to work hard and face a few rejections before finally receiving an offer letter.

                                    However, the real challenge starts after getting the job. You are starting your professional career and it’s very important that you start off well in your first job. Your first job teaches you a lot not only in terms of your skills but also on how you need to carry yourself in a professional setup.
                                    
                                    Many youngsters make a lot of mistakes during the first job and especially during the first year due to the lack of exposure and understanding of the office environment.
                                    
                                    This blog is intended to give you some tips and suggestions on how to prepare yourself mentally before joining in your first company. All that I am going to write is a combination of my experience, observation, and result of some discussions with other graduates who are doing their first job.
                                    <br>
                                    <b>1- THE FIRST IMPRESSION IS THE LAST IMPRESSION</b>
                                    You have always heard “the first impression is the last impression” and it remains true at your job as well. What kind of an impression you create on your manager, team lead and peers through your dressing, nature, and words will matter a lot in the time to come.
                                    
                                    My advice in this regard will be to think more and act less during the first one or two weeks of your job. This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t be talking and participating in team activities.
                                    
                                    The point is to give yourself enough time to see people around, try to understand the office culture, learn the behavioral patterns of your teammates and managers. You need to behave and act according to the nature of every individual. So, it’s important first to make sure that you understand everyone around you.
                                    
                                    EXAMPLE:
                                    Let’s say you are sitting in your first team meeting with everyone around and they are discussing a problem that you know about. Instead of directly raising your hand and start answering the solution of the problem, I would advise you to first think about the problem, the context and make sure you have a clear idea, prepare your words and then raise your hand to add your comments.
                                    
                                    The risk with the first approach is that if you start speaking without giving it a proper thought and you get stuck while explaining your idea or maybe in your communication, you will get noticed.
                                    
                                    People will form an opinion about you due to this small glitch and let me tell you, opinions formed early are hard to change.
                                    
                                    P.S: I am not asking you to stop participating and contributing to your team meetings. All I am saying is to make sure you take your time and cross-check everything before jumping in and that too only in the beginning of your career. Once you get comfortable, you can, of course, be more expressive.
                                    <br>
                                    <b>2- KEEP IT PROFESSIONAL (BEHAVIOR AND PRIVACY)</b>
                                    This is one of the hardest lessons to learn during the early days of your professional career. Coming straight out of the university environment, it is difficult to adjust to the professional arena.
                                    
                                    This step can be easy for people who are introverts and take their time before trusting someone. But people who are expressive, outspoken and extroverts, need to remain mindful of the phrase “Keep it professional”.
                                    
                                     Just like everywhere, you will find good and bad people in professional life as well. The trick is the same and that is to take your time before trusting someone. Remember, you can be loyal, honest and friendly while still maintaining a professional relationship.
                                    
                                    It is advisable to not share much about your personal life and especially about your dependencies on the job unless you really know someone and trust them.
                                    
                                    Always be on the safe side in terms of your behavior. Remember, how you talk and behave with your colleagues will form your personality.
                                    
                                    My advice in this regard will be to maintain an open and friendly relationship but always give an impression of demanding respect. Never let anyone disrespect you even as a joke.
                                    <br>
                                    <b>3- THIS IS BUSINESS (MINDSET)</b>
                                    Your job is someone else’s business and business is based on profit. During your job, you need to quickly identify your strengths and skills. The services that you can offer to the company against the salary package that you are getting.
                                    
                                    Polish your skills and start making money for the company because they are not going to keep on paying you bucks for the learning only. Most of the youngsters do not understand this point. You need to produce money for the business in order to get money from your employer.
                                    
                                    Business deals can end whenever the employer feels that you are not producing the results that justify your salary package. The same is true on your part, you can quit whenever you feel that you are not getting paid enough against your services. It is important to understand how the company’s business works at least on the broader level.
                                    <br>
                                    <b>BREADTH VS DEPTH:</b>
                                    Depth is about having knowledge, understanding and work experience of one specific domain and tool set. Breadth, on the other hand, is about having hands-on experience of multiple tools and domains.
                                    
                                    At the beginning of your career, it is good to create depth in a specific domain and tool set. For example, if you are hired as a machine learning engineer, make sure to start owning that title. Build your knowledge base around the field and get working experience of the related tools. Ideally speaking, you should be able to provide consultancy and independently solve problems in that domain.
                                    
                                    Depth will not only give you a stable career path but will also help you to stand out in your job. The breadth will follow automatically as your progress in your career.
                                    
                                    Be aware of your skillet and always keep a check on your career goals align with the company’s future vision to stay competitive.
                                    <br>
                                    <b>CONCLUSION</b>
                                    Managing yourself properly during your first job can be a tricky thing. My advice would be to give your best and stay true to your values.
                                    
                                    I hope this blog gave you some insights and tips on how you can better prepare for your first job. Some of you reading this may not agree with all the points and others may fully support my opinions. The purpose of writing this was to make sure the youngsters are aware that corporations are not the same as universities. It requires a change in attitude and mindset to be successful in your first job.
                                    
                                    But no matter how much we try; mistakes will happen and that is part of life. What’s important is that you learn from those mistakes and apply yourself better next time. That’s called experience.
                                    
                                    Strive for excellence and have a great life!</p>
